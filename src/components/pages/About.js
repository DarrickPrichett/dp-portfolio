    <p>
    Hello, My name is Darrick Prichett and I am a full stack web developer. I enjoy participating in the design and creation of scalable software. I have experience writing clean, functional code on both the front-end and back-end of a project.  
    I utilize both client-side and server-side design architecture. Building the front-end of applications through appealing visual design. Developing and managing well-functioning databases and applications. I write effective Web APIs including Third-Party APIs as well as  Server-Side APIs. 
    Testing and fixing bugs or other coding issues is another passion of mine. Testing software to ensure responsiveness and efficiency, troubleshoot, debug and upgrade software.
    Creating security and data protection settings. Building features and applications with a mobile responsive design.
